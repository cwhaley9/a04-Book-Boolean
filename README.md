Welcome to Book Boolean. I utilized google books API (fetching books) and tenor API (fetching random GIF) for this project. The idea is that you insert the genre of the book you're looking for and begin selecting book 1 or book 2. It works like a tournament; at the end, you will be shown your 'winner' (AKA, the book you should next read) and a celebratory GIF.
